## Honor code violations
In the event that a student is found to have violated the honor code (including through Early Resolution), the penalty may include a full denial of credit for the course (not just the assignment). See the Student Conduct Penalty Code, Section J.

## Students with Documented Disabilities:
Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is made. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. For more information: http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/oae


## Grading and late policies
* 45% Problem Sets (15% each)
* 10% Project proposal
* 40% Project presentation and report
* 5% Participation and collegiality

Problem sets and project proposal: your best bet is to hit all the deadlines. Failing that, the following policy is designed to prioritize completing problem sets vs. not completing, submitting problem sets vs. not submitting.  
- One single delay of up to 2 days (48 hours), no questions asked. 
- After that: 5 points deducted per day (per 24h, including weekends), up to 6 days. Limited CA availability. 
- After that: no CA support will be provided and max grade is a 70. Must be submitted by Monday Dec 5, 11:59p PT (after that, grade is 0), and no guarantees on grading turn-around time.

Project: No extensions on the project. If you need an extension, please contact me to discuss my policy for taking an “incomplete” for the course.

In the event of a family or medical emergency, I am fundamentally a reasonable person.
